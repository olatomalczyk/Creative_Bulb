## Inspiration
We chose this project because nowadays it is more and more difficult to meet a person without a smartphone, and as a result, mobile applications are more and more often used in many areas of everyday life. It is a great convenience and very convenient to be in possession of the device that we can always carry with us and use it almost to everything. Such a device already has almost everyone, our application focuses partially on the second point, i.e. the ability to use the phone for everything.
